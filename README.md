Experiments with Leptos and SSR / SSG.

I provided some tools to:
- inject tags into `<head>`
- have top-level async components
- clean Leptos SSR output by removing extra tags since we won't hydrate the app

This is based on the `islands` branch of Leptos, that by default won't generate
hydration ids.
